# WikiLinks

## Purpose

I have always loved the idea of Wikis. So much so that the current state of how most are organized is unconscionable. My goal is to provide a framework that will parse the most common Markdown uses for each article, and provide an easy to use navigation infrastructure so users can easily find related articles.

It may also be a really lame excuse to use Angular on a larger scale, and write my own full scale parser.
